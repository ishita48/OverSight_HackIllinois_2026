OverSight UI/UX Design Bible
The Complete Guide to Crafting a Voice-First Storytelling Experience

Core Design Philosophy
OverSight is not a SaaS product. It's a digital campfire where founders come to reflect, not pitch. Every pixel should whisper "you're safe here, tell your real story."
What OverSight IS:

A warm, intimate space for vulnerability
A friend who listens without judgment
A mirror that shows your journey beautifully
Notion's elegance meets Headspace's warmth

What OverSight IS NOT:

Corporate or sterile
Data-heavy or dashboard-y
Bright, loud, or demanding
Another productivity tool


Global Design System
Color Palette
Primary Background: #FDFCFB (warm off-white, like aged paper)
Secondary Background: #F7F5F2 (subtle warmth)
Text Primary: #2C2825 (warm black, never pure black)
Text Secondary: #6B6560 (warm gray)
Accent Warm: #E4B08F (muted terracotta)
Accent Cool: #8B9DC3 (dusty blue, for CTAs)
Success: #7FB069 (sage green)
Error: #D4735F (muted coral)
Typography System
Headlines: "Playfair Display" or "Crimson Pro" (serif with soul)
Body: "Inter" or "Source Sans Pro" (clean, readable)
Accent/Handwritten touches: "Caveat" or "Amatic SC" (for personality moments)

Scale:
- Hero: 48-56px (rare, only for major moments)
- H1: 32-36px
- H2: 24-28px
- Body: 16-18px (prioritize readability)
- Small: 14px
- Micro: 12px (use sparingly)
Spacing & Layout

Use 8px grid system religiously
Generous whitespace - let everything breathe
Max content width: 720px for text, 1200px for app
Padding: 24px minimum on mobile, 48px on desktop
Border radius: 12-16px (soft, never sharp)
Shadows: Subtle, warm - box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)

Animation Principles

Everything eases: transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
Micro-delays between elements: 50-100ms
Hover states lift slightly: transform: translateY(-2px)
Loading states pulse gently, never spin
Page transitions fade through white, not black

Micro-Interactions & Details
Loading States

Never use spinners
Use skeleton screens with gentle pulse
Loading messages that evolve: "gathering thoughts..." → "almost there..."

Toasts/Notifications

Slide in from top-right
Soft shadows
Auto-dismiss after 4s
Icons: Phosphor or Lucide (never FA)

Empty States

Always include warm illustration
Message + helpful action
Never say "No data" - say "nothing here yet"

Error States

Never aggressive red
Use warm coral
Helpful, human messages: "hmm, something's off. let's try again?"
Always provide action

Hover States

Every interactive element responds
Subtle color shifts
Micro-movements (scale, translate)
Cursor changes appropriately


Voice & Copy Guidelines
Always lowercase:

Button text
Short actions
Casual messages

Sentence case:

Headers
Longer explanations
Formal sections

Never use:

Corporate speak ("leverage", "utilize")
Tech jargon (unless explaining features)
Exclamation points (except rare celebration moments)
ALL CAPS (except legal requirements)

Personality examples:

Instead of "Profile": "your story"
Instead of "Settings": "preferences"
Instead of "Error 404": "we got lost"
Instead of "Loading...": "gathering thoughts..."
Instead of "Submit": "share" or "done"
Instead of "Delete": "forget this"


Responsive Considerations
Mobile (< 768px):

Single column layouts
Bottom sheet modals
Larger touch targets (min 48px)
Simplified navigation
Voice button more prominent

Tablet (768px - 1024px):

Two column where sensible
Side panels for navigation
Adjusted typography scale

Desktop (> 1024px):

Full experience
Keyboard shortcuts active
Hover states enabled
Multi-panel layouts


Performance & Polish
Image Handling:

Lazy load everything
Blur-up placeholders
WebP with fallbacks
Max image width: 1200px

Animations:

Respect prefers-reduced-motion
GPU-accelerated transforms only
No animation longer than 400ms
Stagger multi-element animations

Accessibility:

ARIA labels on all interactions
Focus states clear but beautiful
Keyboard navigation perfect
Screen reader friendly copy


The "Wow" Factors

State Persistence:

Remember where users left off
Smooth recovery from disconnects
Draft states that feel magical


Thoughtful Details:

Time-aware greetings
Weather-aware color temps (subtle)
Celebration moments for milestones
Surprise & delight copy variations


Polish:

No jarring transitions
Everything feels "buttery"
Consistent, predictable behaviors
Zero broken states




What NOT to Do
❌ Bright, harsh colors
❌ Corporate blue/gray schemes
❌ Robotic or formal language
❌ Dense information layouts
❌ Aggressive CTAs or growth hacking
❌ Generic SaaS patterns
❌ Stock illustrations
❌ Complicated onboarding
❌ Feature overload
❌ Disrespecting user emotion

Final Thoughts
OverSight should feel like:

A late-night conversation with your smartest friend
A leather journal that writes itself
A mirror that shows your best self
A campfire that never goes out

Every design decision should ask: "Does this make the founder feel heard, understood, and powerful?"
If you can look at any screen and think "I want to tell my story here" - you've succeeded.
Remember: We're not building software. We're building a sanctuary for founder souls.
